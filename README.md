<h2>MetaSploit</h2>

>*Metasploit is a powerful open-source framework for simulating real-world cyberattacks. It enables ethical hackers to automate vulnerability assessments and test system defenses. With modules for exploits, payloads, and auxiliary tools, it streamlines offensive security tasks.
From network testing to exploit development, Metasploit is essential for any cybersecurity toolkit. 💻🔐 use, set, exploit — and you're in control.*

<h2>HashID</h2>

>*This toolkit includes hashid for identifying hash types and John the Ripper for cracking them. It supports multiple formats and cracking methods like brute force, dictionary attacks, and rule-based single mode. Utilities like zip2john, rar2john, and ssh2john convert files into crackable hash formats. These tools are essential for cybersecurity professionals during penetration testing and password audits.*

<h2>TCPDump</h2>

>*tcpdump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer tool used to capture and inspect network traffic in real time. It allows users to filter packets by protocols, ports, IP addresses, and more, making it useful for network troubleshooting and security analysis. tcpdump works by sniffing packets from a network interface and displaying them in a readable format.*

<h2> UnSecure Protocols </h2>

>*Many commonly used network protocols still transmit sensitive information in plaintext, leaving data exposed to interception and attacks. For instance, DNS queries are visible unless secured with DNSSEC, and WHOIS records can reveal personal details like names, emails, and phone numbers of domain registrants. File transfers via FTP lack encryption, making FTPS or SFTP essential alternatives. Similarly, email protocols such as SMTP, POP3, and IMAP send or sync data without default encryption—posing risks unless upgraded to secure versions like SMTPS, POP3S, or IMAPS using encryption layers like STARTTLS. Telnet, another outdated protocol, also transmits data unencrypted, making it a high-risk choice. Staying informed and using secure protocol versions is key to protecting your data and enhancing overall cybersecurity.*
